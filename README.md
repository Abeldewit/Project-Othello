# Project-Othello
DKE Project 2.1 - 2018

Two player board game project where the aim is to develop algorithms which are able to play the game as good as possible. Furthermore, opponent modeling and/or multi-player models may be explored, if relevant.

First Phase Description: 
  Make an analysis and model of the data structures and algorithms needed (possibly in a UML like style) to implement your game. Implement - in Java - the game chosen such that two human players can play it "on the computer" and make sure you have a good visualization of the game. 
  Start to research different algorithms to design a computer player capable of playing against a human. Argue why, from a mathematical viewpoint, your evaluation function is good. To obtain a good evaluation function it is useful to do a literature study of available A.I. techniques. Decide which ones you will use for your game.
